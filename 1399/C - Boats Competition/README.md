The weight of the $$$i$$$-th participant is $$$w_i$$$. Only teams consisting of <span class="tex-font-style-bf">two</span> people can participate in this competition. As an organizer, you think that it's fair to allow only teams with <span class="tex-font-style-bf">the same total weight</span>.</p><p>So, if there are $$$k$$$ teams $$$(a_1, b_1)$$$, $$$(a_2, b_2)$$$, $$$\dots$$$, $$$(a_k, b_k)$$$, where $$$a_i$$$ is the weight of the first participant of the $$$i$$$-th team and $$$b_i$$$ is the weight of the second participant of the $$$i$$$-th team, then the condition $$$a_1 + b_1 = a_2 + b_2 = \dots = a_k + b_k = s$$$, where $$$s$$$ is the total weight of <span class="tex-font-style-bf">each</span> team, should be satisfied.</p><p>Your task is to choose such $$$s$$$ that the number of teams people can create is the <span class="tex-font-style-bf">maximum</span> possible. Note that each participant can be in <span class="tex-font-style-bf">no more than one</span> team.</p><p>You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.
